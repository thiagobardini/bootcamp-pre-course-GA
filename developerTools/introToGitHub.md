## What Is GitHub?
GitHub is a company that’s famous for the platform it built to manage Git repositories in the cloud.

On GitHub, developers can share their code, comment on it, and review changes. It’s an implementation of the same Git software you installed on your computer, but it also comes with some additional features.
In a lot of ways, GitHub is like Dropbox.

You have a folder in the cloud — your remote repository — that syncs with your computer. You can share this remote repository with others, grant them special permissions, and view different versions of your files.

### The GitHub Flow

The workflow for contributing to an open-source product or your dev team’s project comprises the following steps:

- Forking
- Cloning
- Editing
- Adding/committing
- Pushing
- Submitting a pull request

### Step 2: Cloning
To make a local copy of a fork, you’ll clone the repository. This will save the code on your machine so you can edit it.
To do so, open your terminal, navigate to where you’d like to store the repository, then type:
````
git clone https://url-to-clone
````

You can find the URL to clone by clicking the green button that says “Clone or download.”
