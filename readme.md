## Lapis, Papyrus, Scalpellus DOM Manipulation
Now that we have the ability to update the elements on the page, “Lapis, Papyrus, Scalpellus” can really begin to take off.

We’ll start simple, by taking our existing work and adding one DOM function: the game results on the page. We’ve been using console.log to track this information so far, but it’s time to go big.

To start, let’s add some basic HTML in the HTML panel on CodePen — maybe the name of the game and any introductory message you want to include.

Then, create a new function to display the result of the game on the webpage.

> Hint: You already have these results written out in the console.log in your conditional statements.
> Think through how you can change them to display as a new HTML element.
