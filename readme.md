## Enhancing Lapis, Papyrus, Scalpellus
The ancient Romans were all about efficiency. They’d be extremely flattered and grateful if you would make their game more efficient using functions. (Can you say blessings from Jupiter?)

Redefine the separate pieces of action in the game as individual functions. This creates more testable and readable code.

For now, you should include the following functions:

- computerChooses(): The random index you generated.
- compareChoices(): The conditional logic that compares the player’s and computer’s choices.

Test the code by changing the player’s choice and see what happens in the console. Don’t forget to invoke your functions after you’ve called them.
