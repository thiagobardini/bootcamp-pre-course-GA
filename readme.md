## Game Introduction:  An Exciting Discovery
Imagine that you’re an archaeologist and you’ve just uncovered evidence of a game that the ancient Romans played, called “Lapis, Papyrus, Scalpellus.” You want to recreate it online to show the world your discovery. (Surprisingly enough, the game is exactly the same as the one we modern-day humans know as “Rock, Paper, Scissors.” Some things never change.)

## Rules of the Game:
The objective of "Lapis, Papyrus, Scalpellus" or “Rock, Paper, Scissors”  is to defeat your opponent by selecting a weapon that defeats their choice under the following rules:
 
   - Lapis(rock) smashes (or blunts) Scalpellus(scissors), so Lapis wins
   - Scalpellus cut Papyrus (paper), so Scalpellus(scissors) win
   - Papyrus (paper) covers Lapis (rock), so Papyrus (paper) wins
   - If players choose the same weapon, neither win and the game is played again
